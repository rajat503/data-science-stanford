TASK: Word Origin

DESCRIPTION. You will now be shown a series of multiple choice questions. For each question, we will display a word
and ask you to predict its origin.

CORPUS: Word list from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_English_words_by_country_or_language_of_origin
		Latin words that don't occur in French from http://www.eupedia.com/europe/words_with_latin_roots_unique_english.shtml
	
METHODOLOGY: 
	TASKS
	A random sample of 5 words with French origin.
	A random sample of 2 words with Latin origin was chosen which aren't of French origin.
	A random sample of 5 words with Germanic origin.
	Handpicked, not so obvious, 8 words from other origins- 3 from Indian, 3 from Oriental and 2 from Irish. 
	The order of sample of 20 words thus obtained was shuffled.
	Our sample isn't representative of the universe so as to prevent rightly guessed answers.

	ANSWERS
	Random order of French, Latin, Germanic, Indian, Oriental, Irish.
